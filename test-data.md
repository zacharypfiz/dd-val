**Yes—you can build a genuinely useful prototype without their live data.** Use a mix of **public datasets with codebooks** and **synthetic datasets + synthetic dictionaries** that you deliberately corrupt to mimic real issues. That’s enough to validate DD-Val’s core behavior (diff + completeness + “since last run” + query pack) and to demo value credibly.

## How I got there (why this is feasible)

- Your MVP relies on **structure** (columns, types, allowed values, units) and **drift**—not domain-specific secrets.
- Those patterns are **universal** across tabular research data.
- You can **manufacture** the exact failure modes you need (renames, unexpected categories, unit mix-ups, missing dictionary fields) without real PHI.

---

## Where to get “good enough” data dictionaries (no access needed)

- **Public health surveys with codebooks:** NHANES, BRFSS, ACS microdata (these come with variable lists & value labels).
- **Synthetic clinical data:** **Synthea** (open synthetic EHRs with consistent CSV schemas), **CMS SynPUF** (synthetic claims).
- **Standards as dictionaries:** OMOP CDM specs, basic FHIR profiles (use a trimmed subset as a “dictionary”).
- **REDCap exports:** Use the **public REDCap data dictionary template** (CSV) format—easy to emulate and very common in practice.

_(You don’t need their specific forms; you just need one or two dictionary formats your parser supports—start with a simple CSV/XLSX schema and a REDCap-style CSV.)_

## The better approach: build a **seeded test corpus**

Create ~10–15 tiny “projects,” each with:

- **dataset.csv** (50–2,000 rows; 10–60 columns)
- **dictionary.csv** (your minimal schema: variable, label, type, allowed_values, units?, timepoint?)
- **seeded issues** to exercise checks:

**Core scenarios to cover**

1. **Missing/extra columns** (dict↔data asymmetry)
2. **Type drift** (int↔string, date formats YYYY-MM-DD vs MM/DD/YYYY)
3. **Domain drift** (allowed_values vs observed values; case/whitespace variants)
4. **Unit hints** (cm vs in; mg/dL vs mmol/L ranges)
5. **Timepoint merges** (visit variables V1/V2 present but undocumented)
6. **Multi-select/checkbox fields** (REDCap-style _\_1, _\_2 …)
7. **Since-last-run** changes (new col, renamed col, new category only)

**Why this works:** you completely control the ground truth, so you can calculate precision/recall and hit your ≤10s runtime target.

## Simple, impactful tool you can ship now

Stick to your **Data Dictionary Validator** with two outputs:

- **report.html** (one page)
- **findings.json** (machine-readable)

And include the tiny **“Since last run”** section if `-prev` is provided. That’s enough to be sticky.

---

## Limitations (be honest)

- You won’t perfectly mirror every local quirk (e.g., site-specific REDCap naming, rare derived-variable conventions).
- Footnote/derivation registry and policy-specific rules will be better with real feedback.
- That’s fine: your MVP’s purpose is to **prove immediate value on universal problems** (ambiguity + drift).

## Practical action plan (you can do this solo)

1. **Define the dictionary schema** you’ll support first (CSV/XLSX with: variable, label, type, allowed_values, units?, timepoint?).
2. **Build the seeded test corpus** (scripts to generate clean + corrupted datasets).
3. **Implement checks** (columns/type/domain/missingness + “since last run”).
4. **Generate report.html + query pack + findings.json.**
5. **Benchmark** (100k×500 synthetic worst-case), track false positives/negatives.
6. **Demo with public data + your seeded sets** (record GIFs, include 1–2 reports in the README).
7. **Then ask** for either (a) a **15-min screen-share** or (b) a **redacted dictionary + tiny export** to validate on their flavor—no PHI leaves their machine.
